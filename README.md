# Butterfly
Butterfly is a distributed inference system for transformers and large language models. It solves LLM scaling problems by distributing inference across multiple nodes, enabling efficient computation for models too large for single machines. Butterfly uses novel algorithms for partitioning transformers and minimizing communication overhead.
