**Key Innovation**: Tight integration via correlation IDs enables seamless navigation:
- Dashboard metric spike → Click trace exemplar → View trace in Jaeger
- Jaeger span → Click trace_id → View logs in Loki
- Log error → Click trace_id → View full request flow

### Distributed Tracing

**W3C Trace Context Propagation:**
- Injected into all inter-node messages (gRPC metadata, QUIC streams)
- Parent-child relationships maintained across cluster
- 50+ instrumented spans covering all critical paths

**Sampling Strategy:**
- 100% of errors, slow requests, Byzantine faults
- 10% of normal requests
- Tail-based sampling in OTel Collector for smart decisions

**Critical Spans:**
- `inference.request`: End-to-end request flow
- `layer.execute`: Individual layer computation
- `comm.send_tensor`: Inter-node tensor transfer
- `consensus.propose/vote/commit`: Consensus operations
- `checkpoint.create/restore`: State persistence

### Metrics Hierarchy

**8 Metric Categories:**
1. **Request Metrics** (RED): Rate, Errors, Duration
2. **Consensus Metrics**: Term, elections, commit lag
3. **Computation Metrics**: Layer execution, memory, GPU
4. **Communication Metrics**: Network I/O, latency, connections
5. **Resource Metrics**: CPU, memory, GPU utilization
6. **Checkpoint Metrics**: Creation, restore, verification
7. **Coordination Metrics**: Tasks, queues, synchronization
8. **Byzantine Metrics**: Fault detection, verification, reputation

**Cardinality Management:**
- Bounded label cardinality (~1000 nodes, ~200 layers, ~50 error types)
- Recording rules for pre-aggregation
- Downsampling for long-term storage

### Structured Logging

**JSON Format with Correlation:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-11T21:30:45.123Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "message": "Layer execution completed",
  "trace_id": "4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736",
  "span_id": "00f067aa0ba902b7",
  "request_id": "req_abc123",
  "node_id": "compute-node-7",
  "component": "execution_engine",
  "fields": {...}
}
```

**PII Scrubbing:**
- User identifiers hashed with pepper
- Input text replaced with length-only
- IP addresses masked to /16
- Tensor shapes preserved, values redacted

### Debug Console

**Interactive REPL for Operations:**
```bash
butterfly> cluster status          # View cluster health
butterfly> request trace <id>      # Trace request flow
butterfly> state dump <node>       # Export node state
butterfly> profile start <node>    # CPU profiling
butterfly> flamegraph generate     # Generate flamegraph
butterfly> packet capture start    # Network debugging
butterfly> verify node <node>      # Byzantine verification
```

**Capabilities:**
- Cluster inspection and topology visualization
- Request tracing and replay
- State dumps and diffs
- CPU/memory/GPU profiling
- Network packet capture
- Byzantine fault verification

### Health Checks

**Three Levels:**
1. **Liveness**: Is process alive? (HTTP 200)
2. **Readiness**: Can accept work? (Check quorum, resources)
3. **Startup**: Is initialization complete? (Model loaded, network ready)

**Deep Health Checks:**
- Consensus health (leader elected, commit advancing)
- Network health (connections active, low error rate)
- Resource health (memory <95%, CPU <95%, disk >10%)
- Byzantine health (verification passing, reputation >0.5)

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Observability as First-Class Concern
- Every distributed operation is traceable
- Instrumentation is not optional - it's architectural
- Correlation IDs in every observable event

### 2. Low Overhead
- <1% total system overhead
- Metrics: <0.1% CPU
- Tracing: ~1μs per span creation
- Logging: Async, non-blocking

### 3. Bounded Resource Usage
- Cardinality limits prevent explosion
- Retention policies (7d hot, 30d warm, 90d cold)
- Downsampling for long-term storage

### 4. Production-Ready
- Comprehensive alerting (25+ rules)
- Runbook links in every alert
- SLO monitoring (99.9% availability, P99 <5s)
- Debug bundle collection

## Alert Coverage

**25+ Alerting Rules:**
- Request: High error rate, high latency
- Consensus: Below quorum, leader instability, stalled commits
- Byzantine: Fault detection, verification failures, low reputation
- Resources: High memory, GPU overheating, low disk
- Network: Partition, packet loss, high latency
- Checkpoints: Verification failures, slow creation, disk errors
- Coordination: Queue buildup, high reassignment rate
- SLO: Availability and latency breach detection

## Grafana Dashboards

**Overview Dashboard** includes:
- Cluster status (active nodes, quorum)
- Request rate, error rate, P99 latency, throughput
- Byzantine fault rate
- Request rate time series
- Latency percentiles (P50, P95, P99, P99.9)
- Top 10 slowest layers
- Node resource utilization
- Network bandwidth
- Consensus health
- Top 10 nodes by request count
- Error breakdown by type

**Additional Dashboards** (specifications to be created):
- Request latency deep dive
- Consensus monitoring
- Network performance
- Resource utilization
- Byzantine fault analysis
- Checkpoint monitoring

## Swarm Intelligence Methodology

This design was created using a meta-orchestrator approach with 5 specialized agents:

1. **METRICS_ARCHITECT**: Designed Prometheus metrics hierarchy (8 categories, 50+ metrics)
2. **TRACE_ARCHITECT**: Designed OpenTelemetry distributed tracing (W3C trace context, sampling)
3. **LOG_ARCHITECT**: Designed structured logging with correlation (JSON, PII scrubbing)
4. **DEBUG_ARCHITECT**: Designed debugging tools (REPL, profiling, packet capture)
5. **HEALTH_ARCHITECT**: Designed health check system (liveness, readiness, deep checks)
6. **SYNTHESIS_COORDINATOR**: Harmonized outputs into unified platform

Each agent worked independently on its domain, then outputs were synthesized into a cohesive architecture with tight integration points.

## Success Metrics

**Operational:**
- Mean Time To Detection (MTTD): <1 minute
- Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR): <15 minutes
- Alert noise: <5 false positives per day
- Dashboard load time: <2 seconds

**System:**
- Observability overhead: <1%
- Metric cardinality: <1M active series
- Trace ingestion: 10K spans/sec
- Log ingestion: 100GB/day

**Team:**
- Engineers can debug distributed issues in <30 minutes
- 95% of issues diagnosed without SSH to nodes
- Zero production incidents due to observability blind spots

## Next Steps

1. **Review and Approve**: Team reviews design, provides feedback
2. **Implementation**: Follow 4-week implementation plan
3. **Testing**: Load test observability stack at scale
4. **Documentation**: Create runbooks for all alerts
5. **Training**: Train team on debugging workflows
6. **Monitoring**: Monitor observability system health
