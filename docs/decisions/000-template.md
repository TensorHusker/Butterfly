## Notes

This template follows the [Michael Nygard ADR format](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) with extensions for our specific needs.

Key principles:
1. **Be specific**: Vague decisions lead to confusion
2. **Be honest**: Document real reasons, not idealized ones
3. **Be complete**: Future maintainers need full context
4. **Be concise**: Respect the reader's time
5. **Be immutable**: Create new ADRs to supersede old ones rather than editing
